## 🧠 What’s Inside  

Each folder in this repository represents **a specific course**, named by its official **course code** (e.g., `PRF192`, `CSI104`, `DBI202`, etc.).  
Inside each course folder, you’ll find:  

- 📘 **Collected Final Exam Questions** — gathered from previous semesters across different batches and majors  
- 🗂️ **Multiple Versions** — if available, includes exam sets from different terms (e.g., Fall 2023, Summer 2024, etc.)  
- 🚫 **No Answers Provided** — only raw questions are included, to encourage fair and self-driven learning  
- 🧩 **Organized Format** — cleaned and standardized file naming for easy browsing and revision  

> All materials are carefully compiled from the **FUOverflow** community and student contributions.  
> The goal is to help learners **practice with real past questions** while keeping the experience fair and transparent ✨
